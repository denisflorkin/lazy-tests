Use a "Composite" when you have state management inside your component.

A "Composite" is a component that is not dumb, it has some smarts coded in it (usually revealed by some internal state management)


Also sometimes, you want to reuse some layout with different components.

If you have a lot of layouts, you might want to create a fodler speficifcally dedicated to those.
But if you only have a few, just use a composite
